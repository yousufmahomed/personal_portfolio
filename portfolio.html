                    <p>It categorizes the tutorials into relevant sections and includes our twitter feed and relevant documents they will need while working under me.</p>
                    <p>It currently has a membership of over 400 doctors and students from all around the globe and is constantly growing.</p>
                    <p>It is also a wonderful place to view my public speaking, leadership, and training capabilities.</p>

                    <img src="/images/eda1.jpg" alt="Emergency Department Assistant website main page">
                    <p>This website was developed to assist new doctors and students who may be exposed to an emergency department for the first time</p>
                    <p>It provides guides to most aspects of seeing a patient in an emergency area, along with more complicated calculators to assist in diagnosis</p>
                    <p>It is a large project that is still being expanded, but is in use by the same cohort of doctors as for the learning group</p>
                    <p>Kindly visit project to see its scope and size</p>

                    <p>This website was developed to assist the hospital I am based at by digitizing our monthly rosters so that they could be easily changed if needed and would be available to all the doctors in our district.</p>
                    <p>It is currently under review by the management and will hopefully be in use soon. It is currently a mock roster, not using real names or contact details.</p>
