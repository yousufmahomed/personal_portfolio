            <h2>My Medical Career</h2>
            <article class="written-section">
                <p><span class="written-section written-start">Introduction</span><br>I am Currently the Head of Department of emergency medicine at Madadeni Regional Hospital in Newcastle KZN, South Africa. <br>I have been heavily involved in emergency medicine since 2015 and am a member of the Emergency Medicine Society of South Africa. <br>
                Prior to joining this department I was a General Practitioner on the East Rand of Johannesburg (Specifically a small town called Springs), and had worked as a GP for ten years. <br>
                 Although I loved my GP practice I found myself yearning for the excitement of the emergency area, and have always thrived in a fast-paced, high-pressure work setting. <br>
                    Before my foray as a GP, I was a medical officer in the Surgical Department of Pholosong Hospital (also in Springs), and had also completed my community service year there. <br>
                    My internship year was done at George Hospital in the Western Cape. <br>
                    All these experiences have shaped me into the Doctor I am today.</p>

            <article class="written-section">
                <p><span class="written-section written-start">Education and Training</span><br>
                I completed my schooling at Springs Secondary School. <br>
                My medical training was done at the Medical University of South Africa (MEDUNSA) from 1997 - 2002. <br>
                I am also a certified ATLS, Advanced ACLS/PALS/POCUS provider, and have completed multiple other short course over the years relating to general practice and emergency Medicine</p>

            <article class="written-section">
                <p><span class="written-section written-start">Professional experience</span><br>
                  Having 20 years of experience has allowed me to see nearly the full gambit of conditions related to general and emergency practice. <br>
                   My work now focuses mainly on administration, mentoring, teaching and guiding (through bedside, online and written material) the younger doctors in my department. <br>
                   Please see my <a href="/portfolio.html">Portfolio page</a> to see examples of my teaching and training programs, as well as my extensive medical writing </p>
