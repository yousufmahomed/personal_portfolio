            <article class="written-section">
                <p><span class="written-section written-start">Why Salesforce/CRM?</span><br>I was introduced to Trailhead in June 2022. <br>
                    It seemed like a natural progression as Medicine also has so many elements related to Customer(patient) relationship management. <br>
                    You are also selling your brand as a doctor, and have to look at potential patients as leads, bring them in as opportunities and then deal with issues and cases as a result of your treatment. <br>
                    The future of medicine is in the cloud , is a firm belief of mine!!(I have even had the opportunity to even contribute to our provincial E-Health Initiative). <br>
                    By combining my Salesforce Learning and basic programming knowledge, I have also improved knowledge access and dissemination in my department at the hospital. <br>
            <article class="written-section">
                <p><span class="written-section written-start">Goals</span><br>
                    I must admit, I found it very challenging initially to understand business processes and thinking <br>
                    But after 6 months I really started to grasp the essence of it and despite failing my first exam , I passed the administrator exam in February 2023. <br>
                      I combined this with understanding basic programming, and started using <br> Free code camp<i class="fa-brands fa-free-code-camp"></i> <br> The Odin Project <img src="/images/odinproject.png" alt="The odin project logo"> <br> and The Learn enough series <img src="/images/learnenough.png" alt="The learn enough series logo"> <br> to become adept at basic front end development <br>
                        I am by no means an expert but have a good grasp of the concepts and these made my salesforce journey easier, adding context to my learning of the platform <br>
                         Using the courses provided by Mike Wheeler has also vastly improve my understanding ( I have even completed the career launch accelerator programme) <br>
                         Currently I am studying towards my Platform App Builder Certification and hope to write (and pass!!) during 2023 <br>
                         I am in the process of completing various superbadges on the platform as well, and am hoping to gain experience via Part-time work. <br>
                        I am hoping to ,mainly, study the full gambit of admin certifications over the next 12 months, and even the web-developer certifications as my programming knowledge grows. <br>
                        My hope is to combine the medical and CRM/programming spheres of my knowledge to provide a holistic approach to health data management for potential employers.</p>

                <p><span class="written-section written-start">The Future</span><br>
                  I am currently working on a CRM style emergency department app for use by doctors to decrease errors via data validation and on-page guidance for abnormal findings and values. <br>
                   Although in its infancy, it is already shaping up to be a valuable tool, that I may bring to market if fully functional <br>
